# Deep Arbitrage Free Regularization
This code is accompaniment for the paper "Deep Learning in a Generalized HJM-type Framework through Arbitrage-Free Regularization" by A. Kratsios and C. Hyndman; available on ArXiV.  


# How to Use:
## First: 
   Read/Import data-set to bond.data
## Second
*Run Main_NS*
or
*Run Main_dPCA*
depending on which model to test.  

# Important:
Both the Nelson-Siegel and dynamic PCA experiments should be run separately since they share common portions of the code.  Failure to do so will corrupt one of the two predictions!
